# TODO: Import necessary libraries
# - TensorFlow/Keras for building and training the CNN
# - NumPy for numerical operations
# - Matplotlib for plotting (if needed)
# - OS and other utilities for file handling

# TODO: Load and preprocess the dataset
# - Load the dataset (e.g., from local directories or a dataset like CIFAR-10)
# - Normalize pixel values to the range [0, 1]
# - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets

# TODO: Perform data augmentation (if applicable)
# - Apply transformations like rotation, flipping, and zooming to enhance model robustness

# TODO: Define the CNN model architecture
# - Initialize a Sequential model
# - Add convolutional layers with activation functions (e.g., ReLU)

# - Add dropout layers for regularization (if necessary)
# - Flatten the output and add fully connected (Dense) layers
# - Specify the output layer with the appropriate activation function (e.g., softmax for multi-class classification)

# TODO: Compile the model
# - Choose an optimizer (e.g., Adam)
# - Define the loss function (e.g., categorical cross-entropy for multi-class classification)
# - Specify evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy)

# TODO: Train the model
# - Set the number of epochs and batch size
# - Provide the training and validation data
# - Implement callbacks (e.g., ModelCheckpoint, EarlyStopping) to monitor training

# TODO: Evaluate the model
# - Assess the model's performance on the test set
# - Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
# - Generate a confusion matrix to visualize classification performance

# TODO: Save the trained model

# TODO: Visualize training results
# - Plot training and validation accuracy and loss over epochs to assess model performance

# TODO: Implement functions for making predictions on new data
# - Load and preprocess new images
# - Use the trained model to predict classes
# - Interpret and display the prediction results

# TODO: Document the code
# - Add comments and docstrings to explain the functionality of each part of the code
# - Ensure readability and maintainability

# TODO: Handle potential errors and exceptions
# - Implement error handling to manage issues during data loading, model training, etc.

# TODO: Optimize hyperparameters (optional)
# - Experiment with different architectures, learning rates, batch sizes, etc., to improve performance
