# TODO_1(Styve): Import necessary libraries
# - TensorFlow/Keras for building and training the CNN
# - NumPy for numerical operations
# - Matplotlib for plotting (if needed)
# - OS and other utilities for file handling

# TODO_2(Styve): Load and preprocess the dataset
# - Load the dataset (e.g., from local directories or a dataset like CIFAR-10)
# - Normalize pixel values to the range [0, 1]
# - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets

# TODO_3(Styve): Perform data augmentation (if applicable)
# - Apply transformations like rotation, flipping, and zooming to enhance model robustness

# TODO_4(Sergio): Define the CNN model architecture
# - Initialize a Sequential model
# - Add convolutional layers with activation functions (e.g., ReLU)
# - Include pooling layers (e.g., MaxPooling2D) to reduce spatial dimensions
# - Add dropout layers for regularization (if necessary)
# - Flatten the output and add fully connected (Dense) layers
# - Specify the output layer with the appropriate activation function (e.g., softmax for multi-class classification)

# TODO_5(Sergio): Compile the model
# - Choose an optimizer (e.g., Adam)
# - Define the loss function (e.g., categorical cross-entropy for multi-class classification)
# - Specify evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy)

# TODO_6(Sergio): Train the model
# - Set the number of epochs and batch size
# - Provide the training and validation data
# - Implement callbacks (e.g., ModelCheckpoint, EarlyStopping) to monitor training

# TODO_7(Serge): Evaluate the model
# - Assess the model's performance on the test set
# - Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
# - Generate a confusion matrix to visualize classification performance

# TODO_8(Serge): Save the trained model
# - Save the model architecture and weights for future use

# TODO_9(Serge): Visualize training results
# - Plot training and validation accuracy and loss over epochs to assess model performance
