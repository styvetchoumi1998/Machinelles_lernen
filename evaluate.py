# TODO: Import necessary libraries
# - TensorFlow/Keras for loading the trained model
# - NumPy for numerical operations
# - Matplotlib for plotting (if needed)
# - Scikit-learn for evaluation metrics (e.g., confusion matrix, classification report)
# - OS and other utilities for file handling

# TODO: Load the trained model
# - Specify the path to the saved model
# - Use appropriate functions to load the model architecture and weights

# TODO: Load and preprocess the test dataset
# - Load the test data (e.g., from local directories or a dataset like CIFAR-10)
# - Ensure the data is preprocessed in the same way as during training (e.g., normalization)
# - Prepare the data for evaluation (e.g., batching)

# TODO: Make predictions on the test dataset
# - Use the model to predict classes for the test data
# - Store the predicted labels for further analysis

# TODO: Calculate evaluation metrics
# - Compute accuracy to assess overall performance
# - Generate a confusion matrix to visualize true vs. predicted labels
# - Calculate precision, recall, and F1-score for detailed performance analysis

# TODO: Visualize evaluation results
# - Plot the confusion matrix using a heatmap for better understanding
# - Display sample test images along with their predicted and true labels

# TODO: Analyze model performance
# - Identify classes with low precision or recall
# - Investigate potential reasons for misclassifications
# - Suggest possible improvements or next steps (e.g., more training data, model tuning)

# TODO: Document the evaluation process
# - Add comments and docstrings to explain each step of the evaluation
# - Ensure the code is readable and maintainable

# TODO: Handle potential errors and exceptions
# - Implement error handling to manage issues during data loading, model evaluation, etc.

# TODO: Save evaluation results
# - Save metrics and visualizations to files for future reference
# - Consider logging results for tracking model performance over time
